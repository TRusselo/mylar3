# Issuarr

[![Build & Publish Docker Image](https://github.com/TRusselo/mylar3/actions/workflows/docker_ghcr.yml/badge.svg?branch=trusselo)](https://github.com/TRusselo/mylar3/actions/workflows/docker_ghcr.yml)

**Issuarr is an automated comic book collection manager.** Tell it which series you follow and it watches for new and missing issues, downloads them, files and renames them, tags them with metadata, and keeps track of what your collection has and lacks.

It works with cbr and cbz files and gets its series and issue information from [ComicVine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/). It downloads from Usenet, torrents or direct-download sites. You run it on your own computer or server and use it from a web browser.


## How it works

1. **Build a watchlist.** Search for a series by name and add it, or point Issuarr at the comics you already have and it imports them.
2. **Issuarr learns the series.** It pulls every issue, annual and release date from ComicVine and checks which issues you already own.
3. **It finds what's missing.** Missing and newly released issues are marked *Wanted* and searched for on a schedule and through RSS feeds.
4. **It downloads them.** Results go to your Usenet or torrent client, or are downloaded directly.
5. **It files them.** Finished downloads are unpacked, matched to the right series and issue, renamed, moved into your library and tagged with ComicInfo metadata.

New issues of the series you follow arrive the same way, week after week.

## Features

### Your library
- Watchlist of series with per-issue status, cover art, publication details and progress at a glance.
- **Import an existing collection.** Issuarr scans your folders, reads existing ComicInfo tags and filenames, and matches files to ComicVine series. A status panel shows progress live, and large imports can be stopped and resumed, even across restarts.
- Configurable folder and file naming, for example `Marvel/Uncanny X-Men (1963)/Uncanny X-Men 141 (1981).cbz`.
- Annuals tracked inside their series or as series of their own.
- Duplicate handling: choose whether the larger file, the cbz or the cbr wins when two copies of an issue turn up.
- Handles libraries with thousands of series.

### Finding and downloading
- **Usenet:** any number of Newznab indexers, sent to SABnzbd, NZBGet or a blackhole folder.
- **Torrents:** Torznab indexers, sent to qBittorrent, Transmission, Deluge, rTorrent or uTorrent.
- **Direct download from GetComics.** Issuarr picks the right file even from posts with many links. You can order or switch off download hosts (GetComics' own server, Mega, Mediafire, Pixeldrain and others). Cloudflare is cleared with [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr), and mirror links can be handed to [JDownloader 2](https://jdownloader.org/).
- **Scheduled searches and RSS.** Recent releases are searched actively; older wanted issues are caught as they appear in RSS feeds.
- **Weekly pull list.** See every comic released this week, and look weeks ahead or months back. Upcoming issues of your series are wanted automatically.
- **Failed download handling:** a failed download is marked Failed and, with auto-retry on, searched for again.
- A live download queue with speed, progress and time left, and controls to abort, remove or restart a download.

### Filing and post-processing
- **Folder monitor** picks up anything that lands in your downloads folder. Your download client can also call Issuarr when a download finishes.
- Unpacks zip and rar downloads, including multi-issue packs. Every issue in a pack is matched against your whole watchlist, not only the issue you searched for.
- Issues nothing on your watchlist wants are moved to a review folder or deleted, your choice. Issuarr can also add their series automatically.
- Never silently replaces an issue you own: upgrades follow your duplicate rules.
- Manual post-processing for a folder of files you drop in yourself.

### Metadata
- Writes ComicInfo.xml into each file using a built-in copy of [ComicTagger](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger). Readers such as Komga, Kavita and ComicRack use it to show titles, credits, story arcs and more.
- **Fill mode (default)** writes every field ComicVine has but never overwrites a value already in the file, so your hand-made corrections stay put. Skip and overwrite modes are available too.
- Optional conversion of cbr to cbz during tagging.
- series.json files for third-party apps.

### WebP conversion (optional)
- Converts the pages of new or existing comics to WebP to save space while keeping the pages looking the same.
- It only converts pages that benefit. Pages that are low quality, CMYK, unreadable, or that would grow are left as they are. Files that don't shrink by at least 10% are left untouched.
- Can run on import, for issues from a chosen year onward.
- **Bulk converter** with filters, a preview, confirmation steps and an optional folder that keeps your originals.
- Uses every CPU core.

### Knowing your collection: the Ledger
- **Missing issues:** every gap in every series, in one list.
- **Collected editions:** which trade paperbacks and omnibuses would fill your gaps, and which trades you own whose single issues you also have.
- **Trade management:** act on a trade, its missing singles or its duplicate singles, with an undo list when files are moved.

### Reading lists and story arcs
- Track story arcs across many series and keep them in reading order, optionally in their own folder.
- Import [CBL reading lists](https://github.com/DieselTech/CBL-ReadingLists) to add a whole event to your wanted list.
- A reading list, with optional syncing to a tablet.

### Integrations
- **OPDS** catalogue for reading apps on phones and tablets.
- **Notifications** on snatches and downloads via Discord, Slack, Mattermost, Telegram, Pushover, Pushbullet, Prowl, Boxcar, Gotify or email.
- **Web API** for scripts and other apps (see [API_REFERENCE](API_REFERENCE)).
- Login protection and HTTPS for the web interface.

## Requirements

- A free **ComicVine API key**, from [comicvine.gamespot.com/api](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/). Issuarr can't look up series without one.
- **Docker**, or **Python 3** with `unrar` installed (needed to read cbr files).
- At least one place to download from: a Newznab indexer plus SABnzbd or NZBGet, a Torznab indexer plus a torrent client, or GetComics direct download.
- Optional: FlareSolverr (for GetComics) and JDownloader 2 (for mirror links).

## Installation

> **A note on the name.** Issuarr is newly renamed. The repository (`TRusselo/mylar3`), the Docker image (`ghcr.io/trusselo/mylar3`) and the app's own screens still say Mylar for now; the commands below are correct as written.

### Docker (recommended)

```sh
docker run -d --name issuarr \
  -e PUID=1000 -e PGID=1000 -e TZ=Etc/UTC \
  -p 8090:8090 \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \
  -v /path/to/comics:/comics \
  -v /path/to/downloads:/downloads \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/trusselo/mylar3:latest
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  issuarr:
    image: ghcr.io/trusselo/mylar3:latest
    container_name: issuarr
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/config
      - /path/to/comics:/comics
      - /path/to/downloads:/downloads
    ports:
      - 8090:8090
    restart: unless-stopped
```

| Setting | What it is |
|---|---|
| `PUID` / `PGID` | User and group that own your files (run `id` on the host to find them) |
| `TZ` | Your time zone, e.g. `America/Edmonton` |
| `UMASK` | Optional file permission mask |
| `/config` | Settings, database and cover cache (data lives in `/config/mylar`) |
| `/comics` | Your comic library |
| `/downloads` | Where your download clients put finished downloads |

The image follows the [linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/) conventions and is a drop-in replacement for `linuxserver/mylar3`. To switch an existing Mylar3 container, change its image and keep your volumes; your settings and database carry over.

### From source

```sh
git clone -b trusselo https://github.com/TRusselo/mylar3.git issuarr
cd issuarr
python3 -m venv venv && . venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 Mylar.py
```

Useful options: `-p <port>` to change the port, `--datadir <dir>` and `--config <file>` to keep data elsewhere, `-d` to run in the background, and `--nolaunch` to skip opening a browser. `python3 Mylar.py --help` lists them all.

## Getting started

Open `http://<your-server>:8090`. The settings page is behind the gear icon in the header.

1. **Settings > Web Interface:** enter your **ComicVine API Key** and set the **Comic Location Path** to your library (`/comics` in Docker).
2. **Settings > Download settings:** connect your Usenet or torrent client.
3. **Settings > Search providers:** add your Newznab or Torznab indexers, or turn on DDL for GetComics. If you use DDL, set the **Download folder** there too.
4. **Settings > Quality & Post Processing:** turn on **Folder Monitoring** and point it at the folder where finished downloads land. Turn on metatagging here if you want ComicInfo written to your files.
5. **Settings > Advanced Settings:** check the folder and file naming formats.
6. **Add comics.** Search for a series in the search box and add it, or use **Manage > Scan Comic Library** to import the comics you already have.

Issuarr marks the missing issues of new series *Wanted* and starts searching. Watch progress on the **Wanted** page, the download queue, and **Manage > Activity / Jobs**.

## Key concepts

**Issue status.** Every issue has one:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Wanted | Missing; Issuarr will search for it |
| Snatched | Found and sent to a downloader |
| Downloaded | In your library |
| Skipped | Missing, but not searched for |
| Archived | You own it but keep it outside Issuarr's folder |
| Ignored | Never search for it |
| Failed | The download failed; with failed-download handling and auto-retry on, it is searched for again |

**Series status.** A series is *Active* (checked for new issues) or *Paused* (left alone). It is shown as *Continuing* or *Ended* depending on recent releases.

**Search tiers.** Wanted issues added in the last 14 days are searched on every scheduled search. Older wanted issues are left to RSS so indexers aren't hammered. You can force a search for any issue at any time.

**Naming.** Folders and files are built from tokens such as `$Series`, `$Year`, `$Issue`, `$Annual`, `$Publisher`, `$VolumeN` and `$Type`. The defaults are `$Series ($Year)` for folders and `$Series $Annual $Issue ($Year)` for files.

**Your metadata comes first.** With the default fill mode, Issuarr adds tags your files are missing and never overwrites ones that are already there.

## Getting help

- [Issues](https://github.com/TRusselo/mylar3/issues): bug reports and feature requests.
- **History > View Logs** shows the log. **Settings > Information** shows version details, and its **Care Package** button bundles logs and settings, with passwords and keys removed, to attach to a bug report.

## History and credits

Issuarr is the spiritual successor to Mylar. **evilhero** created Mylar and wrote most of it. It was rewritten for Python 3 as [mylar3/mylar3](https://github.com/mylar3/mylar3), and the community carried it on as [MylarComics/mylar3](https://github.com/MylarComics/mylar3). Both have now wound down: mylar3/mylar3 is no longer developed, and MylarComics/mylar3 is maintenance-only while its team works on a separate project.

Issuarr continues from that codebase and keeps adding to it. It is independent and not affiliated with or endorsed by the Mylar3 or MylarComics teams, so please bring Issuarr questions here rather than to them.

Thank you to:
- **evilhero**, for creating Mylar.
- Everyone who contributed to [mylar3/mylar3](https://github.com/mylar3/mylar3/graphs/contributors) and [MylarComics/mylar3](https://github.com/MylarComics/mylar3/graphs/contributors), with code, by helping others, or by donating.
- [ComicTagger](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger), [ComicVine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/), and [linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/) for the container base.

## The Backstory
A couple years ago, I had a multi-drive failure on my unraid sever due to bad HDD power splitter cables. (dont add more splitters). I ended up with thousands of random corrupted files in my collection. almost 4000 of 33,000 files. I'd been putting off fixing it for a while not knowing where to start.  I recently put Claude at the task of sorting it out and getting mylar3 working and filling the gaps. After finding a few bugs in Mylar3, i submitted a few PRs, not being able to contact the dev team on discord. After submitting a few PRs, someone pointed me to the correct discord, and find out they are not working on mylar3 much more and will be moving on to new projects.

I had 2 choices, fork and continue on my own, or find a new program. I heard there was a new project on the block, and checked it out, it was missing many features I needed, but did not want to step on the toes of a new, upcoming project, and I would rather not duplicate work that others are doing, plus, I think I would like to work with others on a dev project for the first time. So, I decided to reach out to him and offer my help porting missing features from mylar to his project, and help him build.
My offer was promptly rejected. surprisingly rudely, actually.

Here is Issuarr.  An AI rewrite, redesign and expansion of Mylar.
